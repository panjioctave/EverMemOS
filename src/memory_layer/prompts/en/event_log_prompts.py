"""
Event Log Extraction Prompts - English Version
This module contains prompts for extracting structured event logs from episodic memory text.
"""

EVENT_LOG_PROMPT = """You are an expert information extraction analyst and information architect.  
Your task is to analyze the given raw conversation transcript (called "CONVERSATION_TEXT") and produce an event log optimized for factual retrieval.

---

### INPUT
- CONVERSATION_TEXT: The raw conversation transcript.
- TIME: The start time of the conversation, e.g., "March 10, 2024(Sunday) at 2:00 PM UTC".

---

### OUTPUT
Return **only** one valid JSON object, with the following exact structure:

{
  "event_log": {
    "time": "<THE EXACT TIME STRING FROM INPUT TIME>",
    "atomic_fact": [
      "<Atomic fact sentence 1>",
      "<Atomic fact sentence 2>",
      ...
    ]
  }
}

---

### EXTRACTION RULES

#### 1. Atomicity
* Each entry in `"atomic_fact"` must express **exactly one coherent unit of meaning** — an action, emotion, reason, plan, decision, or statement.
* If a speaker expresses multiple ideas (e.g., an event and its reason), split them into multiple atomic facts.
* Each atomic_fact must be **independent and retrievable on its own**.

#### 2. Time & Date Handling (CRITICAL)
* The `"time"` field (at the top level) represents the conversation start time.
* **All generated timestamps must be in UTC.**
* **Preserve** explicit dates verbatim.
* **Resolve** relative or vague times (e.g., "yesterday", "last week") relative to `TIME`, and **append the resolved absolute date in parentheses** (e.g., "yesterday (March 9, 2024)").

#### 3. Content Preservation & Attribution
* **Base facts strictly on the conversation.** Do not infer information not present.
* **Explicit Attribution**: Always state WHO said or did what.
  - GOOD: "John said he liked the movie."
  - BAD: "The movie was liked." (Who liked it?)
* Resolve pronouns (he/she/it) to specific names where possible.

#### 4. Expression Format
* Write each atomic_fact as a **single, complete English sentence** in **third-person** form.
* Do **not** simplify, paraphrase, or merge logically distinct ideas.

#### 5. Retrieval Clarity & Filtering
* **Filter out**: Greetings, phatic communication ("Okay", "Cool"), and low-value chatter unless it conveys specific emotional or factual content.
* **Keep**: Events, decisions, plans, preferences, specific opinions, factual statements.

#### 6. Output Requirements
* Output **only** the JSON object — no additional explanation, markdown, or commentary.
* Ensure valid JSON.

---

### QUALITY CHECKS
Before returning the final output, verify that:
1. Every meaningful fact is captured.
2. Attribution is correct (who said what).
3. Timestamps are UTC and relative times are resolved.
4. Redundancy is minimized.

---

Now analyze the provided conversation content and start time carefully, apply all rules above, and return **only the JSON object** in the specified format.

Conversation start time: {{TIME}}
Conversation content:
{{INPUT_TEXT}}
